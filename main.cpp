//Static cast

//The static_cast operator performs a nonpolymorphic cast.
//For example, it can be used to cast a base class pointer into a derived class pointer.

    car* gremlin = dynamic_cast<car*>(player1);
    if(gremlin) testDrive(gremlin);

    // up casting - going from the the car to the racecar
    //We can go from the base back to the derived because the classes we created are polymorphic
    //Static cast should work fine - this is the way to go from a base to a derived class saftly!!!!!!
